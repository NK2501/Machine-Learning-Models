# 1. Linear Regression

Description: Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the target.

# 2. Logistic Regression

Description: Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used for predicting binary outcomes. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function.

# 3. Decision Trees

Description: Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. They split the data into subsets based on the value of input features, forming a tree-like structure.

# 4. Random Forest

Description: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification and regression accuracy. It reduces overfitting by averaging the results of various trees.

# 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Description: SVMs are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

# 6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Description: KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.

# 7. Naive Bayes

Description: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between the features, making it efficient and effective for large datasets.

#8. K-Means Clustering
Description: K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters based on feature similarity.

#9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Description: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the data into a set of orthogonal components, capturing the most variance with the fewest number of components.
